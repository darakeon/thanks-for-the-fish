Hello!

Your Mercurial repository was successfully find. Please, be sure a
git repository is initialized on the directory.

In each commit, the command "git add ." is executed before commiting.
The file .gitignore is copied from .hgignore too, being overwritten.

The current version of the program works on ONE branch only.

========================================================================
IMPORTANT:

Just start this process if you intent to finish it. If you stop the
program or answer "No" to abstract commit, YOU WILL NEED TO START THE
PROCESS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING! It happens if a fatal error occurs too.
========================================================================

"Oh, my god! Your program is a shit, how can you do this to me?!"
You are welcome to implement the feature of stop commiting and start
again or even ignore some commit to doing it yourself and keep
commiting automatically after that.
