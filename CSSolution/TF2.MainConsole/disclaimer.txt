Hello!

Your Mercurial repository was successfully find.

In each commit, the command "git add ." is executed before commiting.
The file .gitignore is copied from .hgignore too, being overwritten.

The current version of the program works on ONE branch only.

========================================================================
IMPORTANT:

If you stop the program or answer "No" to commit, it will stop at that
commit and ask to start from there. There is no commit ignoring
implemented.
========================================================================

"Oh, my god! Your program is a shit, how can you do this to me?!"
You are welcome to implement the feature of ignore some commit to doing
it yourself and keep commiting on program after that. The branches
handling is a desired thing too.
