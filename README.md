# Hello!

This is a program to transform a Mercurial repository in a git
repository without throwing away all the commits history.

## Important!

If you stop the program or answer no (`n`) to commit, `you will need
to start from where you stopped!` Cannot skip commits yet. It happens
if a fatal error occurs too.

## Do you think it's incomplete?
You are right. And you are welcome to implement:
- Ignore some commit to doing it yourself and keep commiting
automatically after that;
- Other things you think it should have but virus or, worst, messy
code.
