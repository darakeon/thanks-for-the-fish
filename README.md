# Hello!

This is a program to transform a Mercurial repository in a git repository without throwing away all the commits history.

The current version of the program works on `one branch only`.

## Important!

Just start the process if you intent to finish it. If you stop the program or answer no (`n`) to commit, `you will need to start the process from the very beginning!` It happens if a fatal error occurs too.

## Do you think it's incomplete?
You are right. And you are welcome to implement:
- Stop commiting and start from the point you stopped;
- Ignore some commit to doing it yourself and keep commiting automatically after that;
- Other thing you think it should have but virus or, worst, messy code.
